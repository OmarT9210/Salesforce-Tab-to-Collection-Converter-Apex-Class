# Salesforce Tab to Collection Converter Apex Class
 Used in Salesforce Flow as an invocable action that turns a copy/pasted excel column and turns it into a string collection

I am not a Salesforce Developer by trade. I am a scrappy Salesforce Administrator leveraging self-taught knowledge of Apex, articles, videos, blog posts, and AI. I take no responsibility for any use of this code nor the contents of this project. This is being provided as a template for you to use in good faith in a sandbox to test a functionality that may be very useful to you.
